    "# Introduction in Machine Learning \n",
    "\n",
    "**Chapter 01**    \n",
    "\n",
    "**summary** \n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.Machine learning. \n",
    "\n",
    "By Definition is a field of AI that provides ability to the computer to learn without being explicitly programmed  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Why ML?**  \n",
    "\n",
    "Compare to others ML is very usefully due to; once it programmed, and when it counts a problem it should not programmed again. It is self-learn means it learn from the past experience. \n",
    "\n",
    " ## 2.Types of ML.\n",
    " \n",
    " i)Supervised --> it has inputs as features and output as label\n",
    " \n",
    " ii)Unsupervised --> it has only features (inputs data)\n",
    " \n",
    " iii. iii)Reinforcement --> it learns from outcomes and decide what to do next\n",
    " \n",
    " ## 3.Problems in ML. \n",
    " \n",
    " i. is this 1 or 0? - Classification algorithms \n",
    " \n",
    " ii. is this weird? - Anomaly Detection algorithm \n",
    " \n",
    " iii. How much or How many? - Regression algorithm \n",
    " \n",
    " iv. How is this organized? - Clustering algorithm \n",
    " \n",
    " v. What should I do next? - Reinforcement learning\n",
    " \n",
    " ## 4.Why Python? \n",
    " \n",
    " i. Python is open-source and free software, easy to learn, high level language, portable and extensible\n",
    " \n",
    " ii. Contain a lot of packages and most are used for data science\n",
    " \n",
    " iii. It is interpreter and most of programmer worldwide use python \n",
    " \n",
    " ## 5. Python Libraries \n",
    " \n",
    " i. Scikit-learn is simple and efficient or data mining and analysis, built on numpy and matplotlib, also open source \n",
    " \n",
    " ii. Pandas -Tool for data wrangling(clean), design for quick and easy data manipulation, visualization \n",
    " \n",
    " iii. Numpy - Tool that provide an abundance of useful features for operations on n-arrays and metrics in python \n",
    " \n",
    " iv. seaborn - It focused on the visual of statistical models which includes heat map and depict the overall distributions \n",
    " \n",
    " v. Matplotlib - It enable visualization, bar charts, scatter plots, line chart, histogram, pie charts contour plots et\n",
